# 📊 Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the concept and implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the entire process, from data loading to prediction and visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and a single independent variable (X) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

This notebook guides you through:
- Understanding the regression concept
- Implementing it using `scikit-learn`
- Visualizing the regression line
- Evaluating the model performance

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- What is Simple Linear Regression?
- Least Squares Estimation
- Training vs Testing data
- Evaluation Metrics (MSE, R²)
- Data visualization using `matplotlib`
